IMPORTANT: Remove SumZero Property from your Github

We noticed that you have published proprietary information regarding SumZero's hiring process (the coding challenges) on your public Github. Doing so explicitly violates the licensing agreement, compromises the integrity of our hiring process, and is unfair to future candidates.

We ask that you remove these repositories immediately and confirm when finished: joe@sumzero.com. Otherwise, we will have to take additional measures.

Joe
