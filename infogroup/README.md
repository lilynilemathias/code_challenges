####INFOGROUP DATA challenge


---


* I didn't upload the 'R' data files of tweets because they were too large (100 MB each).

* BUT the challenge was - iterate through 3 large .r files of tweets - they are all organized into a New York borough (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Bronx) followed by the tweet message.

* Iterate (first through one file then through all three) through the Tweets and then give a count of which borough tweets about the "Knicks". The end result should output something like this: {"Manhattan" => 255, "Brooklyn" => 123, "Queens" => 109, "Bronx" => 332, "Staten Island" => 97}

* If you want the R files let me know - i'll upload them sometime
