1. You are given an index.html file with a form - form has an input area for email, first name, last name, and phone number

2. Using Javascript you must validate the forms: email must have an "email format (i.e. 'hello@world.com')", first and last names must not be blank (and I assume no weird symbols either), phone number should fit the format of xxx-xxx-xxxx or (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxxxxxxxxx (make one validation for them or all three for BONUS). Essentially...practice Regex in Javascript as well as Ruby. Clicking submit/apply should validate the form.

3. CSS on the form - make the form have the labels on the left, input boxes on the right - align the labels to the left of the box so that one row reads: EMAIL [BOX]. Button style - they showed a Bootstrap form as an example.
