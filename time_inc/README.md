####Final Round Pair Programming Challenge
* create a new rails app with two models: Students and Courses - where a student can have many courses and each course can have many students
* Students must have a first name, last name, and unique student id
* Courses must have a subject and period that is between 1st-8th period
* Write validations (not necessarily tests) for these models - write a custome validation if you can :D
* AFTER THAT: change the relationships so that there are grades per course per student - make sure you can validate a grade gets saved according to a student and his/her course specifically
* INDEPENDENT of the rails app: write a method that takes ONE argument and returns the sum value of the positive integers up to that number. THEN write it recursively. THEN write a test file for that method.
